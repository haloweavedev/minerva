# Project Minerva: AI-Powered Romance Book Review Chatbot

## Project Overview
Project Minerva is an intelligent chatbot system designed specifically for All About Romance, a WordPress-based romance book review platform. The chatbot aims to enhance user engagement by providing natural, context-aware conversations about romance books, reviews, and recommendations.

## Core Objectives
1. Create an intuitive, conversational interface for exploring romance book reviews
2. Integrate seamlessly with existing WordPress infrastructure
3. Provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries
4. Scale efficiently to handle growing user interactions
5. Maintain conversation history and context for meaningful interactions

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Understanding
- Process and understand user queries about books, authors, and reviews
- Handle complex questions about plot elements, character dynamics, and themes
- Support follow-up questions and maintain conversation context
- Example queries:
  - "What are the best enemies-to-lovers romances from 2024?"
  - "Find me books similar to 'The Love Hypothesis'"
  - "What did reviewers say about the character development in this book?"

### 2. Review Integration
- Access and analyze existing book reviews from the WordPress database
- Incorporate user comments and ratings into responses
- Provide balanced perspectives from multiple reviews
- Generate comprehensive summaries of review content

### 3. Recommendation Engine
- Suggest similar books based on user preferences
- Filter recommendations by subgenre, tropes, heat level, etc.
- Consider review ratings and user feedback in suggestions
- Provide personalized reading lists

### 4. WordPress Integration
- Seamless embedding in WordPress pages and posts
- Real-time access to review database
- Consistent styling with website theme
- Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
1. **Next.js 14**
   - App Router for routing
   - Server Components for optimal performance
   - API Routes for backend functionality
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - TypeScript for type safety

2. **UI Components**
   - Shadcn/ui for core components
   - Custom chat interface
   - Loading states and animations
   - Error handling and feedback

### Backend Services

1. **LangChain Framework**
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation
   - Conversation chain management
   - Context window optimization
   - Memory management for chat history

2. **Vector Database (Pinecone)**
   - Store and retrieve review embeddings
   - Semantic search capabilities
   - Real-time updates for new content
   - Efficient similarity search

3. **WordPress Integration**
   - WPGraphQL plugin for data access
   - Custom post type for reviews
   - Real-time content synchronization
   - User authentication integration

### Data Flow
1. Content Processing
   ```
   WordPress Reviews → Vector Embeddings → Pinecone DB
   ```

2. Query Processing
   ```
   User Query → LangChain → Vector Search → LLM → Response
   ```

3. Context Management
   ```
   Chat History → Memory System → Context Window → Response Generation
   ```

## Development Phases
