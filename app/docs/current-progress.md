# Current Progress Report - Project Minerva

## Current Implementation Overview

### Frontend Implementation
- Built using Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router
- Implemented a clean, responsive chat interface using:
  - Shadcn/ui components for consistent design
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Custom fonts (DM Serif Text for headers, Inter for body text)
- Created reusable React components:
  - `ChatInterface`: Main chat container with message history
  - `ChatMessage`: Individual message display with user/bot avatars
  - `ChatInput`: Expandable textarea with send button

### Chat Implementation
- Integrated Vercel AI SDK for streaming responses
- Set up OpenAI integration with GPT-4
- Implemented basic system prompt for romance book expertise
- Added real-time message streaming
- Included loading states and error handling

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design that works across devices
- Message history with automatic scrolling
- Visual distinction between user and assistant messages
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Error state handling
- Loading indicators

### Project Structure
- Organized component architecture
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - UI components in `/components`
  - API routes in `/app/api`
  - Types in `/types`
  - Utility functions in `/lib`

## What's Missing

### 1. RAG Implementation
- No connection to WordPress content
- No vector database integration
- No document retrieval system
- No context-aware responses based on website content

### 2. WordPress Integration
- No WordPress plugin
- No data synchronization
- No authentication integration
- No admin interface

### 3. Advanced Features
- No conversation history persistence
- No user preference tracking
- No recommendation engine
- No content filtering capabilities
- No analytics or monitoring

## Deployment Status
- Successfully deployed to Vercel
- Basic production environment setup
- No monitoring or logging implementation

## Next Steps Recommendation

### Priority Order
1. **Implement RAG System First**
   - This is the core functionality that will make the chatbot useful
   - Enables content-aware responses
   - Foundation for all other features

2. **WordPress Plugin Second**
   - After RAG system is working
   - Ensures we have a working product before integration
   - Allows for proper testing before WordPress deployment

### Reasoning
- RAG implementation is the core value proposition
- Better to have a working, knowledgeable chatbot before WordPress integration
- Allows for proper testing and refinement of the core functionality
- Easier to debug and optimize in isolation
